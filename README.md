## Motivation

It was the year of 2014, when I did jump from working in Mexican companies, to work for an International Company. The rules drastically changed for me.
Now I was playing in a different level: more competitive, more direct-language, more dynamic and more demanding for me to be top-notch, always keeping up with the latest software the world can offer for the technology we were using. It was brutal.  
I went from working into an office 9 to 5, to working remotely from anywhere anytime I wanted.  

We were trusted. We were motivated, but also we were expected to be accountable, which is a skill you don't develop by being micro managed by a bossy supervisor at your local office.  
I was used to be pushed and pulled to do my work. Yes, that's how most of us work in big companies: we become lazy after being rushed all day, that we develop this passive-agressive personality, providing resistance to do the activities we're expected to do in exchange for a salary.

I had to grow up, to elevate my mindset and think about value.  
What value I was giving to the company I was working for?  
What value I was getting back?  
In the quest for knowlegde on how to achieve this undertaking, I decided to express my learnings here, and share with everyone, for I believe good knowledge shall be shared.

This is not new knowledge for the humankind, I didn't invent this, in case you're thinking `Tell me something I don't know`.  
This is a compilation of all I've seen and read outside, this was passed to me from amazing people, mentors, authors of the books I read, admirable bosses; and I want to do the same, share the good practices with everyone else.
