## Motivation
When I took the leap, back in 2012, from working in National companies to working in an International company, the rules suddenly changed for me.
Now I was playing in a different level, more competitive, more assertive, dynamic and demanding to be always updated to the tech scene.
I went from working into an office 9 to 5, to working remote from anywhere anytime I want.
We were trusted. We were motivated, but also encouraged to be accountable, which is something you don't usually learn when you work having a boss supervising you everytime.
I had to grow up, to elevate my mindset and think about value. What value I was giving to the company I was working for ? What value I was getting back ?
In the quest for knowlegde on how to achieve this undertaking, I decided to place my learnings here, and share with everyone.

This is not new knowledge, I didn't invent this.
This is a compilation of all I've seen and read outside, this was passed to me from amazing people and I want to do the same to everyone.


**Note(v0.1.0):**
I'm making this manifesto in spanish because this is my native language, and my ideas flow better in it.
For the next release I'm intended to translate to English, and any colaboration on manifesto document is pretty much welcome via Pull Request.

**Note(v0.1.1):**
I decided to move to english version, since, hell, I have to improve my english. I know I'll have many grammar errors, but, hey, the more you help me notice them, the better for me.
Now you will find more and fresh content in the english zone, and later we will translate to spanish.
Sorry spanish speakers.

*Let's build together an awesome environment for all of us worldwide!*
