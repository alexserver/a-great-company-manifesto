## A and B players

The first time I heard about this term, was from [Guy Kawasaki quoting Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717-steve-jobs-has-a-saying-that-a-players-hire-a):
> "Actually, Steve believed that A players hire A players—that is people who are as good as they are. I refined this slightly—my theory is that A players hire people even better than themselves. It’s clear, though, that B players hire C players so they can feel superior to them, and C players hire D players. If you start hiring B players, expect what Steve called “the bozo explosion” to happen in your organization." -Guy Kawasaki.

### What's the **bozo explosion** ?
The [bozo explosion](https://www.xero.com/blog/2012/05/bozo-explosions) is how Steve refers to the decay of a company, as a consequence of hiring B players that won't care about hiring people with worst performance than themselves.

### What's an A player ?
To my understanding, the A player is "the real deal", "the master", "the winner". This is a person that loves their work, that is passionate about it, and therefore is fully devoted to that.  
If you go further, there is no separation between their personal life and their professional life, because they're always puttin all their eggs on the basket. Always having a wandering creative mind in the pursuit of self improvement. They always evolve.  
This doesn't mean that they will sacrifice their personal time for their work time. A wise person knows how to balance their priorities and not drop their guard on the important things.  
The A player has a hunger for progress, for knowledge, for mastery. They have agile brains always ready to learn something new, and they like to practice their craft.

### What's a B player ?
The B player might not be as passionate as the A one. But he/she is good.
Good enough to get the work done.  
They are accountable, punctual, good workers, but they don't usually cross the border of 9 to 5 routine. They like their spare time, and the same way they respect work time, they expect a company to respect their off time.  
The B player is not always learning, not always spending their time on practicing, but they can be taught. They can be motivated, or leaded towards a specific direction, and they will succeed.

### What's a C player ?
The C player lives on the boundaries of mediocrity, where the good is blurry and the bad shows up.  
A C player can be sloppy, or clumsy; occasionally not paying attention to the details of their work, delivering unfinished work, or untested code.  
Usually, a C player is a B player in an early stage. You can think of an intern making a lot of mistakes in their first work days, but eventually, over time, gaining experience and self confidence.  
When clumsiness doesn't dissapear over time, you might be worried, for that person could not be aware of the wasted time they have spent by no learning from their errors.

### What's a D player ?
Oh, you shall not hire a D player.  
The D player is selfish, careless, sloppy or even worse, bad on purpose.  
The D player takes but no gives back.  
**You shall not hire a D player.**

### What's the right fit to you ?

Well, that depends on what type of company you want to be.

```
*to be approved*  
Being mediocre is not bad, this world needs regular measures so best ones can outstand.
Sometimes people don't want to exploit their potential to the best, or they don't know they can be better, and I personally have respect for that. We're as good as we want and are commited to be.  
**Personal NOTE:**  
The word mediocre has been degraded into a negative association, when this is not the case. 
Mediocre is average, ordinary. It means it is not outstanding.
```

* Hiring C players is Ok if you're satisfied with being average. An ordinary company that makes some profits and learn through the journey. You'll have ups and downs, but you'll be safe as no big risk will be taken.

* Hiring B players will worth the move when you're behind the wheel. You have to lead them, to motivate them, and why not ? even encourage them to become A players. Who knows ?

* Hiring A players will make you excited, will make you enjoy the journey, and you might get out of your confort zone very often, dealing with fears, but being rewarded with valuable learning and this feeling of fulfillment after conquerring your dreams.

A C player will keep the boat on float. A B one will make the company win and growth conservatively, but you've been warned, if you turn your back, your company might sink.  
A players will push a company to the limits, they will make it growth high. But they are expensive.
Usually they're not driven by money, but by wealth. Can you afford one ?

At the awesome company, we love A players. We care about B players and we motivate them to become A ones.
