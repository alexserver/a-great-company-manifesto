# The company

## We chose people

The awesome company choses people over skills. It believes that great people wil triumph over great skills.
Great people has the character to run smoothly in a balanced environment. They don't start fights, they don't go behind others backs to solve problems. They know when to say NO, and when to say YES.
The awesome company knows that is better to invest in good people and help them grow professionally inside the company, than to bring a toxic one with good skills.

## We love remote working

Yes!. The awesome company doesn't believe in being limited geographically. It believes that talent can comes from anywhere, hence it is open to have an international team. It also believes that a person should be obligated to work in the same place everytime. It believes in freedom of choice. That's why the awesome company expects every team member to choose where and when to work, as long as they provide the requested value.

## We don't like to get overburned

We're humans, not machines. Machines can work continuously as long as they get feed. An even machines need rest from time to time for maintainance.  
The awesome company team is formed by people, not by human resources. An individual person must be balanced, happy, mentally healthy in order to perform as their best. People have families, friends, romantic relationships, hobbies, dreams to fulfill.  
That's why the awesome company believes that work should not take important time from them. Everything should be done in no more than 8 hours a day, or maybe 10 if the person wants, but that's their decision. Every team member should know when is good to give more hours, and when is good to press pause in their job routine, and drive the attention to everything else that is also important for them.  
Is a project urgent? That means we're not being well organized. That's a red flag, that says we're not in control of our process. We should take care of the urgent matter, and be sure it doesn't happen again.

## Time off

The awesome company believes that it is ok to be absent from time to time.

## Gender equality

The awesome company doesn't care about a person gender, or sexual preference, but about their believes, and the value they provide.
A person should be treated equally no matter what gender that person has. They should be assessed by the value they provide, and they should be respected equally as any other member of the team.

## Concious business

The awesome company cares about the world. Really. Think about it, unless Elon Musk succeeds on taking us to Mars, we don't have any other place to go in case this one just breaks down. So it believes in being accountable for not doing harm to our planet.
The awesome company have conscious about this. It is in control of all impact that their processes may do on the planet and the society. 

## Money in exchange for value

We believe money is a tool for achieving great things. We believe money is important, but it isn't the most important thing on earth.
