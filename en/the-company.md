# The company

## We chose people

A great company chose people over skills. It believes that a good character triumphs over genius skills.
Usually you wouldn't have to decide between both sides of the coin, but in case you have to decide whether a mediocre skilled employee with good soft skills against an asshole genius, I think you should go for the 
mediocre skilled employee with good soft skills.
Good people has the ability to keep a working environment healthy. They don't start fights out of the blue, they don't derogate coworkers because they ignore something. They put and respect boundaries in a healthy way.
Toxic Geniuses, by the other hand, tend to contaminate a team over time. By complaining about other people's mistakes, by derogating coworkers, trying to absorb as much tasks as they can, trying to shield their code from being touched by the rest of the team.
A great company understands that is better to invest in good people and help them grow professionally inside the company, than to bring a toxic one with good skills.

## We love remote working

A great company doesn't like to be limited by geography. It believes that talent can comes from anywhere, therefore it's open to hire people from all around the world. 
It also believes that a person shouldn't be obligated to work in an office everyday. It believes in freedom of choice. That's why a great company respects every team member to decide where and when to work, as long as they do the work.

## We don't care about geography restrictions

## We hate burnout

We're humans, not machines. Machines can work continuously as long as they get feed. An even machines need rest from time to time for maintainance.  
A great company is made by people, not by human bodies.
A person needs to be healthy, physically, emotionally and mentally in order to perform as their best.
People have families, partners in love, friends, hobbies, life goals, a whole world outside of the working life.
That's why we believe that work should not take all the time and mental effort from them.
40 hours a Week sounds fair, and sometimes we know that the brain is not good enough to sustain long hours of focus. It is what it is.
Is our people working more hours than expected ? that means we're not good at organizing our projects and priorities.
Having a team member working for long hours during a considerate period of time will make them start to make mistakes, to hate what they're doing and only think about quit.

## Time management

We believe that everyone has the ability to decide how and when they work best.
There early birds, and night owls, and people in between.
Early birds often prefer to start early, with a cup of coffee, for the morning is the most productive time of the day for them.
Night owls get more focused at the silence of the night, when the rest is having fun, having dinner, or sleeping.
If someone needs to take some hours off to take their kid to the doctor, go for it, and continue working after coming back home. Your time, your choice.

## Gender equality

A great company respects any gender identification or sexual orientation from the people that work there. A person's personal decisions is a decision that only matters to them, and shouldn't impact their working relations.
Saying that, a great company also believes that people is people, and gender identification doesn't matter for the quality of work a person delivers. So there should be no preference for a specific gender over the rest.

## Concious business

We're not here only for the money. We want to make a positive impact in the world, not only by our business model, but by the way we live.


## Money in exchange for value

We provide money to our people to empower themselves to use at their best to fulfill their goals, to stay healthy, to stay happy.
We expect in exchange that our people provide value to the team it belongs, to company as well.
